# Mastermind
Creates the mastermind game in c++
The game prompts the user to enter a series of 4 digits to match the randomly generated secret code. The user has 10 tries to guess the code and is given feedback on how many numbers are perfect matches, and which of the remaining numbers are correct, but in the wrong position. Upon completion of the game, the user is prompted to retry, or quit.
